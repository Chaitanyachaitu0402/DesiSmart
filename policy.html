    <h1>Clearance / Sale / Promotional Items</h1>
    <p>
      Items in Clearance / Sale / Promotions are as mentioned in the Title of
      the item and or as per the description and will not be based on the
      original package declarations. For example, if an item such as a Tea pack
      is printed with 500g Free Sugar and if we did not mention the same in our
      item title or description, it will not have a 500g Free Sugar along with
      this Tea when we deliver it. The reason for moving this item to clearance
      / sale section could be due to the fact that either those free packs were
      never received from our supplier and or those corresponding free pack were
      damaged and cannot be issued. In conclusion, whatever mentioned in the
      item description will be the final declaration and you will not have any
      right to claim whatever mentioned on the original pack pertaining to free
      combos.
